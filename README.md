* [very_fast_image_resize.py](https://github.com/kool7/Image_Preprocessing_Scripts/blob/master/very_fast_image_resize.py) - This python script resize images very fast. The code is adapted from the youtube video of [Abhishek Thakur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaCFd-vL4HA&t=194s). A very great approach.
